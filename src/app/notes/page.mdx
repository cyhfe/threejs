## light

![light](/images/2.png)

- THREE.AmbientLight: This is a basic light, the color of which is added to the current
  color of the objects in the scene.

- THREE.PointLight: This is a single point in space from which light spreads in all directions.
  This light can be used to create shadows.

- THREE.SpotLight: This light source has a cone-like effect like that of a desk lamp, a spotlight
  in the ceiling, or a torch. This light can cast shadows.

- THREE.DirectionalLight: This is also called infinite light. The light rays from this
  light can be seen as parallel, similar to the light from the Sun. This light can also be used to
  create shadows.

- THREE.HemisphereLight: This is a special light and can be used to create more natural-
  looking outdoor lighting by simulating a reflective surface and a faintly illuminating sky. This
  light also doesn’t provide any shadow-related functionality.

- THREE.RectAreaLight: With this light source, instead of a single point in space, you can
  specify an area from which light emanates. THREE.RectAreaLight doesn’t cast any shadows.

- THREE.LightProbe: This is a special kind of light source where, based on the environment
  map used, a dynamic ambient light source is created to light the scene.

- THREE.LensFlare: This is not a light source, but with THREE.LensFlare, you can add
  a lens flare effect to the lights in your scene.

## material

- MeshBasicMaterial: This is a basic material that you can use to give your geometries a
  simple color or show the wireframe of your geometries. This material isn’t influenced by lights.

- MeshDepthMaterial: This is a material that uses the distance from the camera to determine
  how to color your mesh.

- MeshNormalMaterial: This is a simple material that bases the color of a face on its
  normal vector.

- MeshLambertMaterial: This is a material that takes lighting into account and is used to
  create dull, non-shiny-looking objects.

- MeshPhongMaterial: This is a material that also takes lighting into account and can be
  used to create shiny objects.

- MeshStandardMaterial: This is a material that uses physical-based rendering to render the
  object. With physical-based rendering, a physically correct model is used to determine how light
  interacts with a surface. This allows you to create more accurate and realistic-looking objects.

- MeshPhysicalMaterial: This is an extension of MeshStandardMaterial that allows
  more control over the reflection.

- MeshToonMaterial: This is an extension of MeshPhongMaterial that tries to make
  objects look hand-drawn.
