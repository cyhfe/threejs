- THREE.AmbientLight: This is a basic light, the color of which is added to the current
  color of the objects in the scene.

- THREE.PointLight: This is a single point in space from which light spreads in all directions.
  This light can be used to create shadows.

- THREE.SpotLight: This light source has a cone-like effect like that of a desk lamp, a spotlight
  in the ceiling, or a torch. This light can cast shadows.

- THREE.DirectionalLight: This is also called infinite light. The light rays from this
  light can be seen as parallel, similar to the light from the Sun. This light can also be used to
  create shadows.

- THREE.HemisphereLight: This is a special light and can be used to create more natural-
  looking outdoor lighting by simulating a reflective surface and a faintly illuminating sky. This
  light also doesn’t provide any shadow-related functionality.

- THREE.RectAreaLight: With this light source, instead of a single point in space, you can
  specify an area from which light emanates. THREE.RectAreaLight doesn’t cast any shadows.

- THREE.LightProbe: This is a special kind of light source where, based on the environment
  map used, a dynamic ambient light source is created to light the scene.

- THREE.LensFlare: This is not a light source, but with THREE.LensFlare, you can add
  a lens flare effect to the lights in your scene.
